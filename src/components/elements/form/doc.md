The component AutoForm is a React component that renders a form with input fields and implements form validation logic. It uses useState hook to manage the form data and validation state, and useEffect hook to trigger the form validation whenever the form input or default form values change.

The component takes in two props:

formInput is an array of form fields, each with properties such as name, label, type, validation rule, etc.
formValues is an object that contains the default form values for each field.
The component implements form validation logic in the validation and fieldValidation functions. The validation function checks if all required fields are filled and validates their values according to the specified validation rules. The fieldValidation function checks individual fields for their validity.

The component also implements a change handler handleChange for each input field, which updates the form values in the state whenever a user interacts with the form.

Finally, the component uses useTranslation hook to support internationalization of the form labels.
