The index.js file inside each folder is a styled-components contains common styles that can be used across the entire application. These styles are often reusable, generic components like ColumnContainer and RowContainer.

Here are some best practices and guidelines for organizing and documenting the common.js file:

Folder structure: It's recommended to organize the common styles into a separate file to keep the code organized and modular. This file can be named common.js, globals.js or constants.js.

Naming conventions: Component names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention, such as PascalCase or camelCase. It's also a good idea to include the component's functionality or feature in the name. For example, a ColumnContainer component could be named ColumnContainer, while a RowContainer component could be named RowContainer.

Documentation: Each common component should be well-documented with clear comments that describe its functionality and usage. It's also helpful to provide a brief example of how the component can be used. This will make it easier for other developers to understand and use the component.

PropTypes: PropTypes are a built-in feature of React that allow you to define the expected type of each prop that a component receives. This helps catch errors early and makes it easier to maintain the code. It's recommended to define PropTypes for each common component and its props.

Reusability: Common components should be designed to be reusable across the application. This means they should be flexible and not tightly coupled to a specific page or component. Common components that are used only once or tightly coupled to a specific page or component should be placed in a separate file or directory.

Overall, the common.js file is an important part of any styled-components folder and should be carefully organized and documented to ensure that the code is maintainable and reusable.
