# The router js is suing for creating the router inside the application whether it is authenticated or not authenticated


This code defines a React component called PageRouter. The component uses the BrowserRouter component from react-router-dom to handle client-side routing in the app.

The PageRouter component uses the Routes component from react-router-dom to define several routes for different pages in the app:

A route for the root path ("/") which renders the Login component.
A route for the "/imprint" path which renders the Imprint component.
A route for the "/privacy" path which renders the Privacy component.
A catch-all route ("*") which renders the Page404 component for any other paths not defined in the previous routes.
Finally, the PageRouter component is exported as the default export of the module.
